Block II: Check CPU and system clocks.
system clock (implementation not standardized - compiler dependent)
count rate = 1000: system dependent and can vary depending on the int_kind of the arguments
count max  = 2147483647: typically [ HUGE ( count max ) = 2147483647 ]

total cpu time   = .11383999999999998E-001 s
total clock time = .70791000000000007E-001 s
