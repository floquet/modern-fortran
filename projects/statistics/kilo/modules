Hi Vito:

We are looking forward to working with on the development of our commercial food
preparation facility at 121 Thalweg Road in Vicksburg.

Here is an evolving list of issues we ask you to consider:

1. Pot fillers in the stove areas.
2. We will be using Blossman Gas service which will require a tank and plumbing.
3. How to empty the 40 gallon pots of boiling water? We prefer to empty them
immediately without having to wait for cooling.
4. Can you construct a splash minimizing drain into the grease trap?
5. Handsfree handwashing stations are preferred.
