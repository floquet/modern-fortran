*** A default build of OpenCoarrays requires CMake 3.4.0 or later     ***
*** and MPICH 3.1.4 wrapping GCC Fortran (gfortran) 5.3.0 or later.   ***
*** Additionally, CMake, MPICH, and GCC have their own prerequisites. ***
*** This script will check for most known requirements in your PATH   ***
*** environment variable and in the default installation directory    ***
*** to which this script installs each missing prerequisite.  The     ***
*** script will recursively traverse the following dependency tree    ***
*** and ask permission to download, build, and install any missing    ***
*** prerequisites:                                                    ***

cat: opencoarrays-tree.txt: No such file or directory

*** All prerequisites will be downloaded to, built in, and installed in ***
/Users/dantopa/Box Sync/fortran/coarray/OpenCoarrays-1.3.8/install_prerequisites
*** OpenCoarrays will be installed in the above location also.        ***
